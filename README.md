---------------------
Creating a successful trailer for an ambitious medium-length fiction project about artificial intelligence (AI) involves meticulous planning, creative direction, and technical execution. Since you're working on a fiction project, the trailer will need to capture both the thematic depth of the film (AI and human emotions) and the technological elements. Here's a Python-driven framework to automate some of the technical tasks that can assist in trailer production. This would involve:

    Video editing and post-production automation
    Special effects integration (e.g., creating AI-themed effects)
    Script analysis and key scene extraction

However, creating the full trailer and achieving cinematic quality is an artistic endeavor that would be handled by video editing software such as Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut Pro, along with a professional post-production team.

Here's a Python-based workflow that could assist in specific aspects of trailer production such as script analysis, video editing automation, and some simple visual effects generation. Keep in mind that this is not a full trailer but a part of the process.
Project Breakdown:
1. Script Analysis and Scene Selection

We'll analyze the script and extract important sections (e.g., intense scenes or emotional moments) that can be used in the trailer.
2. Video Editing Automation

Using moviepy (a Python library) to automate some video editing tasks like cutting scenes, adding sound, and applying filters.
3. Visual Effects (Special Effects Integration)

We can add simple AI-related visual effects to scenes using Python libraries, such as creating glitchy AI effects or overlaying futuristic elements.
Python Code:

import moviepy.editor as mp
import numpy as np
from moviepy.video.fx.all import fadein, fadeout
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

# 1. Script Analysis (Example: Identify Emotional or Important Scenes for the Trailer)
def extract_important_scenes(script):
    # Example: Extract lines or scenes containing specific keywords
    important_keywords = ['AI', 'emotion', 'conflict', 'revolution', 'human']
    important_lines = []
    with open(script, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        for line in lines:
            for keyword in important_keywords:
                if keyword.lower() in line.lower():
                    important_lines.append(line.strip())
    return important_lines

# 2. Video Editing: Cut and Fade Scenes
def create_trailer(input_video, output_trailer, start_time, end_time):
    video = mp.VideoFileClip(input_video)
    
    # Cut video between start and end times
    trailer_clip = video.subclip(start_time, end_time)
    
    # Apply fades for smooth transitions
    trailer_clip = fadein(trailer_clip, 1)  # 1 second fade-in
    trailer_clip = fadeout(trailer_clip, 1)  # 1 second fade-out
    
    # Add soundtrack (background music)
    audio = mp.AudioFileClip("background_music.mp3")
    trailer_clip = trailer_clip.set_audio(audio)
    
    # Save the edited trailer
    trailer_clip.write_videofile(output_trailer, codec="libx264", audio_codec="aac")
    
    print(f"Trailer created and saved as {output_trailer}")

# 3. Add Simple Visual Effects (AI-Themed)
def add_glitch_effect(input_video, output_video):
    video = mp.VideoFileClip(input_video)
    
    # Example: Apply a glitch effect to simulate AI interference
    def glitch_effect(get_frame, t):
        frame = get_frame(t)
        if t % 3 == 0:
            frame = np.array(frame)
            # Simulating glitch (randomly shift pixels)
            height, width, _ = frame.shape
            x_offset = np.random.randint(-10, 10)
            frame = np.roll(frame, x_offset, axis=1)
            return frame
        return get_frame(t)
    
    # Apply the glitch effect to the video clip
    video_with_glitch = video.fl(glitch_effect)
    
    # Save the output video with glitch effect
    video_with_glitch.write_videofile(output_video, codec="libx264", audio_codec="aac")
    print(f"Video with glitch effect saved as {output_video}")

# 4. Add AI-themed Text Overlay
def add_text_overlay(input_video, output_video, text, position=('center', 'center')):
    video = mp.VideoFileClip(input_video)
    
    # Define font size and position for text overlay
    txt_clip = mp.TextClip(text, fontsize=70, color='white', font="Arial-Bold")
    txt_clip = txt_clip.set_pos(position).set_duration(3)  # Text duration of 3 seconds
    
    # Overlay the text on the video
    video_with_text = mp.CompositeVideoClip([video, txt_clip])
    
    # Save the final video with text overlay
    video_with_text.write_videofile(output_video, codec="libx264", audio_codec="aac")
    print(f"Video with text overlay saved as {output_video}")

# Example Use Case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Step 1: Analyze the script to identify important scenes
    script = "movie_script.txt"
    important_scenes = extract_important_scenes(script)
    print("Important Scenes Found in Script:", important_scenes)
    
    # Step 2: Create a trailer by selecting specific start and end time
    input_video = "movie_scene.mp4"
    output_trailer = "trailer_output.mp4"
    create_trailer(input_video, output_trailer, start_time="00:01:00", end_time="00:02:30")
    
    # Step 3: Add AI Glitch Effect to the video
    input_video_for_glitch = "movie_scene.mp4"
    output_video_with_glitch = "movie_with_glitch.mp4"
    add_glitch_effect(input_video_for_glitch, output_video_with_glitch)
    
    # Step 4: Add AI-themed text overlay
    text = "AI: The Future or the End?"
    input_video_with_text = "movie_scene.mp4"
    output_video_with_text = "movie_with_text.mp4"
    add_text_overlay(input_video_with_text, output_video_with_text, text)

Explanation of Code:

    Script Analysis (Step 1):
        extract_important_scenes() reads through a script and extracts lines containing important keywords (like "AI", "emotion", etc.), which are relevant for selecting impactful scenes for the trailer.

    Trailer Creation (Step 2):
        create_trailer() uses moviepy to create a trailer by cutting specific scenes based on start_time and end_time.
        It also applies fade-in and fade-out transitions to smooth the video.

    Visual Effects (Step 3):
        add_glitch_effect() applies a simple "glitch" effect to simulate AI interference (which could be useful to depict AI in the film).
        It randomly shifts video pixels to create a digital glitching effect at intervals.

    Text Overlay (Step 4):
        add_text_overlay() adds an AI-related text message (e.g., "AI: The Future or the End?") on the video, simulating the way AI can be represented textually.

Required Libraries:

    moviepy for video editing.
    numpy for manipulating pixel data (used in glitch effects).
    PIL (Python Imaging Library) for drawing text and fonts (optional for advanced customizations).

Possible Enhancements:

    Advanced Visual Effects: Implement more sophisticated effects using dedicated libraries or tools like Adobe After Effects and integrate them through Python.
    Sound Design: Enhance the trailer with appropriate sound effects or dialogue snippets, using moviepy or external libraries.
    Scripting & Shot Planning: Write a more comprehensive script analyzer that could detect emotional tones or actions within the script, helping select optimal footage for the trailer.
    AI Integration for Text-to-Speech: Use AI-generated voices (e.g., OpenAI's GPT or text-to-speech services) to narrate parts of the trailer, adding a futuristic or robotic tone to the voiceover.

This framework can help automate parts of the trailer production, from analyzing scripts to enhancing video content with effects and overlays. The rest of the creative process would involve refining the final product with professional tools and a creative team.
